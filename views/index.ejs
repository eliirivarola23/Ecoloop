                <h2>About ecoloop</h2>
                <p>ecoloop connects people with each other so that uneaten food is shared rather than thrown away. It may be food, vegetables from someone's garden that are not going to be eaten, or food in your refrigerator that you will not eat because you are going on a trip. For your convenience, ecoloop can also be used to share other household items other than food.</p>
